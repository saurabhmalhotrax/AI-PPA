# Advanced Context-Aware Auditing System Plan

## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Goal:** To develop an advanced AI-driven auditing system that emulates the contextual understanding and nuanced decision-making of an experienced human accountant. The system will go beyond simple rule-based checks to identify duplicate invoices and financial anomalies by leveraging a deep understanding of vendor histories, contractual obligations, payment patterns, and other relational contexts.

**Core Idea:** The system will integrate a dynamic knowledge graph, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for contextual understanding, efficient similarity search (FAISS), and a sophisticated AI (e.g., Large Language Model - LLM) for final assessment and explanation.

## 2. Core Architectural Components

### 2.1. Central Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)

*   **Purpose:** To serve as the system's dynamic, evolving memory, capturing the rich tapestry of relationships between financial entities.
*   **Entities (Nodes):**
    *   `Invoice` (e.g., `invoice_id`, `date`, `total_amount`, `line_items_summary`, `status`)
    *   `Vendor` (e.g., `vendor_id`, `name`, `address`, `payment_terms`, `risk_score`)
    *   `Contract` (e.g., `contract_id`, `vendor_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `max_value`, `scope_summary`)
    *   `Payment` (e.g., `payment_id`, `invoice_id`, `payment_date`, `amount_paid`)
    *   `Employee` (e.g., `employee_id`, `name`, `department`, involved in approval workflows - future extension)
*   **Relationships (Edges):**
    *   `Invoice -[:ISSUED_BY]-> Vendor`
    *   `Vendor -[:HAS_CONTRACT]-> Contract`
    *   `Invoice -[:APPLIES_TO_CONTRACT]-> Contract`
    *   `Payment -[:PAYS_FOR]-> Invoice`
    *   `Invoice -[:SIMILAR_TO {score: float}]-> Invoice` (Textual/Embedding Similarity)
    *   `Invoice -[:POTENTIAL_DUPLICATE_OF]-> Invoice`
*   **Data Ingestion:** Continuous, real-time or micro-batch updates from:
    *   Vision AI (for new invoice data).
    *   ERP/Accounting systems (for payment data, vendor updates, contract details).
    *   Human feedback loops.

### 2.2. Graph Neural Network (GNN) Engine

*   **Purpose:** To learn rich, contextual embeddings for all entities in the Knowledge Graph. These embeddings capture not just an entity's own features but also its role and relationships within the broader graph structure. Can also be trained for specific tasks like anomaly detection.
*   **Input:** Subgraphs or the entire Knowledge Graph, node features.
*   **Output:**
    *   **Contextual Node Embeddings:** Dense vector representations for each node.
    *   **(Optional/Advanced) Anomaly Scores:** A score indicating how "unusual" a node or subgraph pattern is compared to learned norms.
    *   **(Optional/Advanced) Link Prediction:** Predicting likelihood of new relationships.
*   **Architecture Examples:** GraphSAGE, GAT, GCN, or custom architectures tailored to heterogeneous graphs.
*   **Training:**
    *   Self-supervised (e.g., link prediction, contrastive learning) to generate general-purpose embeddings.
    *   Supervised (e.g., predicting known fraud, specific compliance violations) if labeled data is available.
    *   Regular retraining on the updated graph to keep embeddings fresh.

### 2.3. FAISS (Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search)

*   **Purpose:** To provide highly efficient initial candidate retrieval for duplicate detection based on content similarity (primarily text embeddings).
*   **Input:** Text representation embedding (e.g., from Sentence-Transformers) of a new invoice.
*   **Output:** A small set (top-N) of the most textually similar existing invoices from the historical dataset.
*   **Integration:** FAISS index built on text embeddings of all historical invoices.

### 2.4. Decision-Making AI (LLM / Advanced Classifier)

*   **Purpose:** To integrate all available signals (raw data, FAISS candidates, GNN embeddings, graph-derived features) to make a final, nuanced decision on whether an invoice is a duplicate, an anomaly, or legitimate. Also, to provide human-readable explanations for its decisions.
*   **Inputs (for a `new_invoice` and a `candidate_invoice` from FAISS, or `new_invoice` alone for anomaly check):**
    *   Raw structured data of `new_invoice` and `candidate_invoice`.
    *   Text similarity score between `new_invoice` and `candidate_invoice`.
    *   GNN-generated contextual embedding for `new_invoice`.
    *   GNN-generated contextual embedding for `candidate_invoice`.
    *   GNN-generated anomaly score for `new_invoice` (if available).
    *   Explicit graph-derived features:
        *   Vendor history (e.g., typical invoice frequency, amount range, time since last invoice).
        *   Contract status and terms related to the vendor/invoice.
        *   Payment history for the vendor.
        *   Number of previous similar invoices from the same vendor.
*   **Output:**
    *   Classification:
        *   Duplicate Confidence Level (e.g., High, Probable, Possible, Unlikely).
        *   Anomaly Type (e.g., Unusual Amount, Deviates from Contract, Suspicious Vendor Pattern).
        *   Legitimate.
    *   Explanation: A natural language summary of the key factors leading to the decision.

## 3. System Workflow (New Invoice Processing)

1.  **Invoice Intake & Vision AI Extraction:** New invoice image/PDF arrives. Vision AI extracts structured data (vendor, date, amount, line items, etc.).
2.  **Knowledge Graph Ingestion & Update:**
    *   Extracted invoice data is parsed and mapped to the graph schema.
    *   New `Invoice` node is created/updated.
    *   Relationships to existing `Vendor` (or new `Vendor` node created) are established.
    *   Links to relevant `Contract` nodes are identified and created.
3.  **GNN Embedding Inference:**
    *   The GNN model infers a contextual embedding for the new `Invoice` node and potentially updates embeddings of affected neighbors (e.g., Vendor).
4.  **FAISS Candidate Retrieval:**
    *   A text representation of the new invoice is created and embedded (e.g., Sentence-Transformer).
    *   FAISS index is queried to find top-N textually similar historical invoices.
5.  **Contextual AI Assessment:**
    *   **For each `(new_invoice, candidate_invoice)` pair from FAISS:**
        *   All relevant inputs (raw data, text similarity, GNN embeddings for both, graph features for both) are compiled.
        *   The Decision-Making AI assesses for duplication.
    *   **For `new_invoice` (even if no strong FAISS candidates):**
        *   All relevant inputs (raw data, its GNN embedding, its graph features, GNN anomaly score) are compiled.
        *   The Decision-Making AI assesses for other anomalies.
6.  **Decision & Action:**
    *   Based on the AI's classification and confidence:
        *   **High Confidence Duplicate / Critical Anomaly:** Flag for immediate block/review.
        *   **Probable/Possible Duplicate / Minor Anomaly:** Flag for prioritized human review.
        *   **Legitimate:** Proceed to next step in payment workflow.
    *   Store AI's decision and explanation in the Knowledge Graph, linked to the invoice.
7.  **Feedback Loop & Continuous Learning:**
    *   Human review outcomes (e.g., "confirmed duplicate," "false positive anomaly") are fed back into the system.
    *   This feedback can be used to:
        *   Fine-tune the Decision-Making AI (e.g., prompts, classification thresholds).
        *   Retrain the GNN with new labeled examples of complex cases.
        *   Improve graph feature engineering.

## 5. Key Considerations & Challenges

*   **Data Quality & Consistency:** Garbage-in, garbage-out. Robust data validation and cleaning are crucial for both graph integrity and GNN/LLM performance.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   Knowledge Graph: Ensuring Neo4j (or alternative) can handle the growing volume of data and query load.
    *   GNN: Training and inference on large graphs can be computationally intensive.
*   **GNN Model Complexity vs. Interpretability:** More complex GNNs might yield better embeddings but can be harder to understand and debug.
*   **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts that guide the LLM to use all contextual information correctly is an iterative art and science.
*   **Computational Costs:** GNN training, GNN inference (especially real-time), and LLM API calls can incur significant costs.
*   **Evaluation Complexity:** Defining "ground truth" for context-dependent anomalies can be challenging. Evaluating the quality of AI-generated explanations is also subjective.
*   **Cold Start Problem:** System performance might be limited initially with a sparse knowledge graph or a GNN trained on insufficient data.
*   **Feedback Loop Latency:** The effectiveness of continuous learning depends on timely and accurate human feedback.

This plan provides a roadmap for building a highly intelligent and context-aware auditing system. Each phase will require significant research, development, and iterative refinement.
